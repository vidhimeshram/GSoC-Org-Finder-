# Contributing Guide

## Program-Specific Guides

If you are contributing under a specific program, refer to the dedicated guide for your track:

| Track | Guide |
|-------|-------|
| GSSoC'26 Contributors | [GSSoC Contributor Guide](docs/GSSOC_CONTRIBUTOR_GUIDE.md) |
| GSSoC'26 Mentors | [GSSoC Mentor Guide](docs/GSSOC_MENTOR_GUIDE.md) |
| NSoC'26 Contributors | [NSoC Guide](docs/NSOC_GUIDE.md) |
| General Contributors | [General Contributor Guide](docs/GENERAL_CONTRIBUTOR_GUIDE.md) |

The rest of this document covers the shared rules, architecture, and workflow that apply to **all** contributors regardless of program.

## Project Philosophy

This repository follows a **zero-build, zero-dependency** philosophy.

### Principles

- No build tools
- No unnecessary dependencies
- Minimal runtime overhead
- Simple, readable, maintainable code
- Fast client-side performance
- Minimal API usage wherever possible

When contributing, avoid introducing libraries, frameworks, bundlers, or unnecessary abstractions unless they are clearly justified.

---

## Architecture

The project is built using **Vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript + Vercel Edge Functions**.

### Core Stack

| Layer     | Technology                  |
|-----------|-----------------------------|
| Frontend  | Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS         |
| Hosting   | Vercel                      |
| Backend   | Vercel Edge Functions       |
| Data      | Static JSON + GitHub API    |
| Analytics | localStorage only           |

### Architecture Goals

- Lightweight runtime
- No build process
- Edge-compatible APIs
- Fast initial page load
- Fully static-first deployment

All contributions should remain compatible with the existing architecture.

---

## Local Development

### Install Vercel CLI

```bash
npm install -g vercel
```

### Clone Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/S3DFX-CYBER/GSoC-Org-Finder-.git
cd GSoC-Org-Finder-
```

### Run Local Development Server

```bash
vercel dev
```

This simulates the Vercel Edge runtime locally.

## How to Start Contributing

### Step 1 — Find an Issue

Go to the repository **Issues** tab and filter using labels:

- `level-1`
- `level-2`
- `level-3`
- `gssoc26`
- `nsoc26`

---

### Step 2 — Request Assignment

Comment with your program:

```
/assign gssoc
```

or

```
/assign nsoc
```

Your request will be **queued** — not immediately assigned. A maintainer must verify the issue and approve assignments.

---

### Step 3 — Wait for Maintainer Approval

This repository uses a **maintainer-verified assignment system**:

1. You request assignment with `/assign gssoc` or `/assign nsoc`
2. Your request is **queued** (you'll see a confirmation)
3. A maintainer verifies the issue and approves assignments
4. You'll be notified when assigned

> **Do NOT start work before assignment.**

---

## 🤖 Smart Assignment System

This repository uses a maintainer-verified assignment system with smart selection.

### Supported Commands

| Command | Who | Action |
|---------|-----|--------|
| `/assign gssoc` | Contributors | Request assignment under GSSoC |
| `/assign nsoc` | Contributors | Request assignment under NSoC |
| `/unassign` | Contributors | Remove your assignment |
| `unassign me` | Contributors | Remove your assignment |
| `/approve-assignment` | Maintainers | Auto-select assignee by timestamp + workload |
| `/approve-assignment @user` | Maintainers | Manually approve a specific user |

### How Smart Selection Works

When a maintainer uses `/approve-assignment` without specifying a user, the system:

1. Finds all assignment requests on the issue (sorted by timestamp)
2. Checks each requester's current workload
3. Assigns the first eligible user (fewest active issues, earliest request)

---

## 📌 Program Declaration

Contributors should mention their contribution track when requesting assignment:

- **GSSoC** — GirlScript Summer of Code participants
- **NSoC** — Nexus Spring of Code participants
- **General** — Independent contributors (no program affiliation)

**Examples:**

> I want to work on this issue under GSSoC.

> I would like to contribute under NSOC.

> I would like to work on this issue as a general contributor.

General contributors do not need to declare a program but must still follow the assignment process.

---

## ⏳ GSSoC Assignment Restriction

> **Important**

GSSoC issue assignments are only allowed after:

**15 May 2026 — 12:00 AM IST**

Before that time:

- GSSoC contributors cannot claim issues
- The bot will automatically reject assignment attempts
- Contributors will receive an automated reminder message

NSoC contributors are unaffected.

---

## 🧠 Automatic Issue Validation

The repository automatically detects and blocks:

- Duplicate issues
- AI-slop issues
- Spam reports
- Copied template spam
- Prompt leakage
- Meaningless low-quality issues
- Bot-generated issue spam

Issues may be automatically:

- Labeled
- Closed
- Redirected to original issues

---

## 🚫 Self-Assignment Restriction

Do **NOT** self-assign issues using the GitHub UI.

Assignments are handled **ONLY** through the automation workflow.

Manual self-assignment may be removed automatically.

---

## 📌 Maximum Active Assignments

To maintain fairness, contributors may only hold a limited number of issues:

| Program | Max Active Issues |
|---------|-------------------|
| GSSoC | 2 |
| NSoC | 3 |

The assignment bot automatically checks this. If you've reached your limit, new assignments will be rejected until you complete or unassign existing issues.

---

## 🔄 PR Consolidation Rule

Contributors are encouraged to combine:

- 1–2 related fixes
- Small connected improvements

into a **single focused PR** instead of opening many tiny PRs.

Low-effort PR spam may be rejected.

---

## ✍️ Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)

This repository enforces the Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO).

By submitting a contribution, you certify that:

- You wrote the code/content yourself, or
- You have the legal right to contribute it

Every commit must be signed off.

### How to sign commits

Use:

```bash
git commit -s -m "feat: add search improvements"
```
---
## 🔕 Maintainer Ping Policy

Please avoid repeatedly pinging maintainers for:
- issue assignment
- PR reviews
- label updates
- merge requests
- priority escalation

Maintainers review contributions in queue order whenever possible.

Excessive pinging, spam comments, or DM requests may result in:
- comment deletion
- temporary assignment removal
- spam labeling for repeated abuse

Please allow reasonable review time before following up.

Recommended wait times:
- Issue assignment: 12–24 hours
- PR review: 24–72 hours

----

## ⚠️ NSoC'26 & GSSoC'26 Contribution Standards

This project officially participates in:

- **NSoC'26**
- **GSSoC'26**

All contributors must maintain contribution quality and fairness.

---

## Assignment Priority Policy

Issue assignments are granted only when the contributor is currently eligible under repository rules.

Commenting first does not reserve or guarantee assignment ownership.

If another eligible contributor claims the issue earlier, the assignment may be granted to them instead.

---

## ❌ Strictly Prohibited

The following may result in rejection or disqualification:

- AI-generated PRs without understanding
- Fake complexity
- Meaningless documentation spam
- Multiple tiny PRs
- Copied contributions
- Template spam
- Low-quality PR farming
- Claiming issues without intention to work
- Opening duplicate PRs/issues
- Unnecessary dependency additions

---

## ✅ What Makes a Good Contribution

Strong contributions usually include:

- Meaningful bug fixes
- Useful features
- Performance improvements
- Accessibility improvements
- Maintainable refactors
- High-quality documentation improvements
- Responsive/mobile improvements
- Testing improvements

Before opening a PR ask:

> Does this meaningfully improve the project?

---

## Pull Request Workflow

### Before Opening a PR

## 🔍 Review Process

PRs go through a **3-stage pipeline**:

| Stage | Reviewer | Checks |
|-------|----------|--------|
| **Stage 1** — Automated | Bot | DCO sign-off, PR format, AI/slop detection, duplicate detection, diff size |
| **Stage 2** — Human Review | Mentor | Code quality, relevance, correctness |
| **Stage 3** — Final Decision | Project Admin | Merge approval |

Stage 2 is blocked until Stage 1 passes. Stage 3 is blocked until Stage 2 passes.

The PR validator also checks:

- Diff size relative to PR type (bug fixes shouldn't be 500+ lines)
- Unnecessary file changes (lock files, unrelated extensions)
- Template completeness

Maintainers may:

- Request changes
- Relabel issues/PRs
- Reject low-quality submissions
- Close spam/AI-slop PRs

---
